# NBATeamsWinsPredML
Predicting the % of wins each NBA team will have based on 2024 data, done both through multiple linear regression and subsequently with polynomial regression. 

## Features used: 
number of all stars in the team, average rating of starting 5 (top 5 players). 

## Other features to be added: 
percentage of wins in the previous season and seed number in the previous season, number of players in an all-defensive team (1st, 2nd or 3rd). 

Furthermore, gathering data from multiple years back instead of only 2024 will be done. 


### This project predicts for the 2024 nba season only.
