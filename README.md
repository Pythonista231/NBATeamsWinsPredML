# Machine Learning for NBA teams' win % prediction
<br></br>
# Overview: 

Developed a machine learning model to predict the percentage of wins for NBA teams based on five key features (based on my extensive data visualisation and feature engineering): 

1. Number of all stars on the team. 
2. Average in-game (2k) rating of the team's top 5 players. 
3. Overall in-game (2k) rating of the NBA team. 
4. Number of wins in the previous season. 
5. Seed obtained in its previous season

# Data engineering: 

Training data - 2024 NBA season. 
Testing data - 2023 NBA season. 

Data was collected through extensive web scraping using Selenium. 

<br></br>

# Feature engineering and data visualisation: 

training data - 2024 nba season
testing data - 2023 nba season. 50-50 split. 

Leveraged Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients alongside RFE for feature selection. 

Visualised relationship between features and the target variable using Matplotlib, including scatter plots of each feature and the target variable and a 3d graph showcasing two key features alongside the target variable.

# Model performance: 

Achieved MAE of ~5% wins of a season, demonstrating high model accuracy.

# This project was developed in 2023 when I was 18, after completing several of DeepLearning.AIâ€™s excellent courses. It combines my passion for data science, Machine Learning, sports tech and basketball.
